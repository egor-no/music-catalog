music-catalog
Catalog of music on physical formats (CDs, vinyls, etc.) This App basically just prints data from the h2 database in pretty way in a browser.

It's very simple, cause it's my first Spring project to learn MVC pattern and Thymeleaf templates. Became the inspiration for another learning project - winylka record store.
